<h1>Spotify Clone API</h1>
*This project is specified for learning*

Implemented a spotify clone using the latest updated Spotify API, and ReactJs.

In this project, I only implemented the basic functionalities of search song, get my own playlists, play songs, search playlists , login- log out authentication, session management and some extra features like random select and play a song.


According to the Spotify API restrictions, currently the song play is set to only 30 seconds, and only plays the song preview.
