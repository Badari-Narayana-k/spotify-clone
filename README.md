<h1>Spotify Clone API</h1>



<h3>This project is specified for learning</h3>

Implemented a spotify clone using the latest updated Spotify API, and ReactJs.

In this project, I only implemented the basic functionalities of search song, get my own playlists, play songs, search playlists , login- log out authentication, session management and some extra features like random select and play a song.


According to the Spotify API restrictions, currently the song play is set to only 30 seconds, and only plays the song preview.

The Recent version of the project specifies the changes in the discover weekly page and the search feature. Using the default Search API feature from the Spotify developers guide implemented the feature of retrieving the songs effectively, Improved the playlist vsibility feature to retrieve all available playlists that the user created.


Goals / future enhancements:

Improving the search Quality and adding the feature to retrieve playlists
Improving the Playllist shuffle experience
Adding song radio option
Creating a Play Queue
Maintaining the record of most playled or most chosen songs by user for faster retrieval and efficent access
